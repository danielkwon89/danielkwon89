### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I'm learning DSA and working on passion projects. Most of my projects are focused on honing my current skills and to gain practical experience with new technologies. I also write articles about web-development and my experiences as an engineer.
